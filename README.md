# UFO

## Overview

### The purpose of this project is to build a database where users can access and filter UFO information based on a set of criteria that best interests them. This database is in a form of a website. The website is constructed using data from different file types in build in html.

## Results

The user can input any criteria they would like into the filter bars.

Entering information in either one bar or several is perfectly okay.

1. Enter information in any of the bars (Date, City, State, Country, Shape)
2. Select the "Search" button


## Summary

- One Drawback

-- The website is not case sensitive or detects any errors in spelling.

-- For example, state abbreviations are usually in upper case, but this website is all lowercase

- Recommendations

-- It would help to have a dropdown list of all potential option, or a narrowed down dropdown as the user was typing.

-- The user should be able to gather UFO sighting from a certain period of time. Over the span of weeks, or years, depending on his/her preference.
